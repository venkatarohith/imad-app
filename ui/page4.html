             <h1>Getting Started with Programming in Java </h1>
             <article>
             <p>
Enough background! Let’s finish off this day by creating two real Java programs: a stand-alone Java application and an applet that you can view in either in the appletviewer (part of the JDK) or in a Java-capable browser. Although both these programs are extremely simple, they will give you an idea of what a Java program looks like and how to compile and run it.

             </p>

      <h2>Getting the Software </h2>

             <p>
In order to write Java programs, you will, of course, need a Java development environment. At the time this book is being written, Sun’s Java Development Kit provides everything you need to start writing Java programs. The JDK is available for Sun SPARC systems running Solaris 2.2 or higher and for Windows NT and Windows 95. You can get the JDK from several places:


             </p>
             <p>
 The JDK can be downloaded from Sun’s Java FTP site at ftp://java.sun.com/pub/ or from a mirror site (ftp://www.blackdown.org/pub/Java/pub/is one).


             </p>
             <p>
Although Netscape and other Java-aware browsers provide an environment for playing Java applets, they do not provide a mechanism for developing Java applications. For that, you need separate tools—merely having a browser is not enough.
